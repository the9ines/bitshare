xcodebuild test -scheme bitshare -destination 'platform=macOS'

# Run specific test suites
xcodebuild test -scheme bitshare -only-testing:bitshareTests/FileTransferProtocolTests
xcodebuild test -scheme bitshare -only-testing:bitshareTests/FileTransferManagerTests
xcodebuild test -scheme bitshare -only-testing:bitshareTests/FileTransferIntegrationTests
xcodebuild test -scheme bitshare -only-testing:bitshareTests/FileTransferPerformanceTests
```

### 2. Manual Testing Scenarios

#### File Transfer Flow Testing
1. **Basic Transfer**

   - Select recipient peer
   - Verify transfer initiation
   - Monitor progress
   - Confirm completion

2. **Multiple Transfer**
   - Queue multiple files
   - Verify priority ordering
   - Monitor concurrent transfers
   - Confirm all completions

3. **Error Recovery**
   - Start transfer
   - Simulate network interruption
   - Verify pause/retry behavior
   - Confirm successful completion

#### Performance Testing
1. **Large File Transfer**
   - Transfer 100MB+ files
   - Monitor memory usage
   - Verify completion time
   - Check file integrity

2. **Stress Testing**

## Test Data Management

### Test File Creation
```swift
// Small test files
let smallFile = Data("Test content".utf8)

// Medium test files
let mediumFile = Data(repeating: 0xAB, count: 1024 * 100) // 100KB

// Large test files
